GOALS:
- javascript vgl
- run from params (no .pr2 files)
	(like the version for edx)
- save state to server
- grade on server

started off
in eclipse
- new google -> web application project
- team -> share project via git
- repo is /Users/briantwhite/git/JavaCodeFromSVN/
- team -> add to index
- team -> commit (initial commit)
- team -> push to upstream

worked.

nuked useless stuff:
-src/edu.umb.jsVGL/client
	GreetingService & GreetingServiceAsnych
package edu.umb.jsVGL.server
package edu.umb.jsVGL.shared

moved in packages
- make new package eg edu.umb.jsVGL.client.GeneticModels
- go into VGLII/GeneticModels
- select all; copy
- click new package; paste

for images, may want to use ImageBundle

http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit-doc-1-5/wiki/DevGuideDefiningAndUsingImageBundle



moved to home mac
needed to adjust build path to add App Engine SDK 1.7.4 
	this eliminates the red exclamation point

start resolving errors:
xml stuff 
	- should be: com.google.gwt.xml.client.Document etc.
	- can't make an Element directly
		need to http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6895322/create-xml-document-on-gwt-client-side
			make a doc and have it make element from a document
		but it can't find the type com.google.gwt.xml.Element even though it's being imported
		need to add the jar
			tried from http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.google.gwt/gwt-user/1.6.4
			got http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/google/gwt/gwt-user/1.6.4/gwt-user-1.6.4.jar
			made folder jsVGL/library (it's in git/)
				put the jar in there
				Project -> java build path
					added jar - gwt-user-1.6.4.jar
				Build project - now OK
it might be better to (from: https://developers.google.com/web-toolkit/doc/latest/DevGuideCodingBasicsXML)
	To get to the DOM nodes from the Document object, we can use one of three methods. 
	The getDocumentElement() method retrieves the document element (the top element at the root of the DOM tree) 
	as an Element. We can then use the navigation methods of the Node class from which Element derives 
	(e.g., getChildNodes(), getNextSibling(), getParentNode(), etc.) to drill down and retrieve the data we need.

maybe use getDocumentELement()?

also, don't addContent(), instead appendChild()

also nuke out all i18n

3/6/12
also nuke out all HTML for grading stuff

for the jDialog()'s (all the cages, etc) => use DialogBox

3/7/13
still working on xml
for the moment, leave out:
	- model builder
	- phenotype images
	- cage manager
comment the out in VGL for now

3/8/13
tried to build
it couldn't find Unable to find 'com/google/gwt/xml/client.gwt.xml'
maybe they're in the classes in gwt-user.jar?
don't download the jar
in project -> properties -> build path
	add it as external jar
		Mac HD/Applications/eclipse/plugins/com.google...../gwt-2.5.0/gwt-user.jar
			(found using spotlinght)
still ng
maybe it was just that I didn't need the line in the JsVGL.gwt.xml file that read
	<!--    <inherits name='com.google.gwt.xml.client.'/> -->


3/9/13
nuked phenotype images

testing git fuckups

3/10/13
still trouble with xml code
googled: eclipse "no source code is available for type com.google.gwt.xml"
https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/google-web-toolkit/tnlRUoaE6ME
added this to JsVGL.gwt.xml
finally OK
 <inherits name ="com.google.gwt.xml.XML"/> 

 - got the UI basically working
 
3/11/13
need to put on hold
things to do:
1) punt summary chart for now
2) have "close work without saving" button to get to new problem
3) need "load work" button
4) disable save in practice mode
5) check inter-cage crosses
6) need to make edx-interaction


3/12/13
testing git nonsense
now from eclipse

4/3/13
working on model builder ui
left off in model pane fixing all errors

4/9/13
lots of work on Model Builder

4/11/13 prefixed all .css styles with jsVGL_ to avoid conflicts with edx and other cms's
working on ThreeIncPanel

4/15/13 finished all MBUI panels' layouts
working on grader output

popup cages are a pain
	they don't drag nicely
	they overlap and it's hard to bring them to the front
	they cover the controls
	they'll be messy in a web-based environment
put them in scrollable list

4/16/13
working on non-popup cages
got them working
working on save state - ok all but ModelBuilderState
working on load state - ok all but ModelBuilderState!

4/18/13
working on loading model builder state
only part NG is getting the interaction details panel to change

programmatically changing the ListBox doesn't fire a ChangeEvent
	you have to do it yourself
	- works!

need to be able to zip the problemXML
use http://code.google.com/p/gwt-lzma/
unzipped in downloads
copied org/ folder to workspace
	it made lots of top-level directories for each subdir!
	try importing it - no good
	drag it in to src/
	
may not work - it looks like zip is not designed to run in a browser
	there's a warning at the site for gwt-lzma
take it out

use one-byte to 2-byte compression
	write algorithm - safe as long as we use ascii
	
just make the xml tags smaller for organisms
	Organism = "O"
		id = "i"
		CageId = "c"
		male = use "S" = "M" (male) or "F" (female)
	Chromosome = "C"
		id = "PA", "MA", "PS", "MS"
		size = "s"
	Allele = "A"
		GeneIndex = "i"
		TraitNumber = "n"

almost working...

4/19/13
got it working
can make it more compact
	for allele, give i = <GeneIndex>,<TraitNumber>
	for organism, collapse id, cageId, sex into comma-sep
seems to be working with 2 genes

set up layout to be more pretty
set up on practice mode
	can't save
	model builder shows model
working!

tried compiling it
runs aok on firefox
on chrome, get error:
Unsafe JavaScript attempt to access frame with URL 
	file:///Users/brian/git/JavaCodeFromSVN/jsVGL/war/JsVGL.html 
	from frame with URL file:///Users/brian/git/JavaCodeFromSVN/jsVGL/war/jsvgl/1629246A986A8ED8C204259F41AF0F24.cache.html. 
	Domains, protocols and ports must match.

really unclear what this means...
some hint here http://maxrohde.com/2011/05/20/gwt-script-does-not-load-in-chrome-and-internet-explorer/
the hint there said to put on web server
tried on securebio and it works!
	http://www.securebio.umb.edu/edX/war/JsVGL.html

problems with supercross
	one with a two gene problem and 2000 offspring saves 290,586 bytes (uncompressed)
	a single field pop cage took 6,020 bytes (uncompressed)
	
possible solution: the problem is just supercross
	- for supercross only:
		just save the organisms that are displayed
		save the counts for display
add field to Organism: visibleInCage - if it is visible in the CageUI
	for regular cages, all are visible
	for super cross, only save and load visible ones

almost working - two bugs
	- on re-open, there are fewer orgs in the supercross panel
	- on re-reopen from intermediate save, there's an error missing parent.
	(probably related)

4/20/13
	- problem is, on save of already processed super cross cage, the code that finds a subset of orgs to display
		loses some because it expects a huge number, so not showing them all is ok
	solution: add boolean alreadyBeenTrimmed (set on loading a supercross from xml) => means:
		- should lay out orgs like regular cross
		- display counts using saved data not counts of organisms saved
took a little doing
	- layout is not exactly the same as regular
	- need to be careful about saving actual counts in super cross vs saved counts
WORKING!

4/22/13
problem with super cross display 
	if only one row of offspring, need to add spacer row just in case
 FIXED

4/23/13
need to export public methods for access from javascript in page
	https://developers.google.com/web-toolkit/doc/latest/DevGuideCodingBasicsJSNI
got it going

some bugs
- sex linkage not grading right
- linkage panel is ugly
